### Find.ips: Indoor Positioning System
November 2018
#### SKILLS: IoT, Deep Learning
#### TOOLS: PyTorch, Arduino, Raspberry Pi 
Acquire Data of RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values of WiFi signals corresponding to the distance from the signal detector. 
Use the acquired data to build a model to predict the distance of source and detector as a function of RSSI
For multiple sources, use RSSI parameter to find position(coordinates) of indicator w.r.t the signal sources in a defined 3D space.

### AutoConnect: Classifier of Health Condition of Automobile
November 2018  
### SKILLS: Machine Learning, Electronics
### TOOLS: SciPy, NumPy, SciKit Learn
Acquire Data from various sensors of components of automobiles and their corresponding operating condition.
Use the above data to train a logistic regression model and hence predict if for a given set of parameters, the system is working or not.
Integrate this regression model with cloud and check in real time the condition of various components of the automobile.
